> The formation of Nolic society pre-boid. Ending with the First Boidic War.
---------------
>> ## <Badge type="warning" text="0F" /> - FORMATION OF THE UNIVERSE
>> #### Celestial
>> The big bang caused a rift in the fabric of reality causing a smaller yet quicker forming universe than the one we currently know. The Boid Universe is a similar but alternate reality from our own.

>> ## <Badge type="warning" text="595F > 600F" /> - THE NOLIC DISCOVERY OF THE BOID COLONIES
>> #### Discovery, Scientific
>> The Nolic ancients discover the Boid colonies in their world. An initial probe into their society discovering they are not traditional fungi spores but contain intelligence albeit a primitive one. After a five year probe takes place they are classified as a planetary nusiance and the nol form the Extermination Squads to thin out any Boid colony that gets to large.

>> ## <Badge type="warning" text="603F > 613F" /> - THE FIRST BOIDIC WAR
>> #### Disaster / Destruction
>> In retaliation to the Extermination Squads, the Larger Boid Colonies pool their resources and the Bonded creatures together to combat the Extermination squad and protect their colonies. Their strategies are rudimentary and only survive as long as they do because of sheer numbers.

>> ## <Badge type="warning" text="613F" /> - END OF THE FIRST BOIDIC WAR
>> #### Era beginning/end
>> With the last of the large Boid Colonies, the Nol have almost completely razed the planet of Boid. Realizing how resource-intensive and time-consuming it would be to hunt down every last Boid spore they repurpose the Extermination Squad to monitor and contain the Boid only taking action if the Boid colonies get beyond a certain size.

> # EXTERMINATIVE GROWTH <Badge type="tip" text="613F > 1013F" />
> The Boid, having been almost completely wiped out retreated away from the Nol. As the Nol expanded at a constant rate the ever present Extermination Squads or XSquads pushed their perimeter killing any and all Boid colonies they came across which is known to the surviving Boid simply as the time of Exterminative Growth.

>> ## <Badge type="warning" text="615EG" /> - FORMATION OF THE TROVI
>> #### Founding
>> After what seemed like a blind massacre and close genocide of the Boid colonies without provocation a minor few of the Nolic council relinquished their seats and formed what is now known as the Trovi. The True Seekers.  Believing that the high intelligence of the Nol had led to blind arrogance and a sense of superiority the Trovi dedicated themselves to continuously seeking out knowledge and to not let themselves become content with what they already knew about the universe. Over time this has been interpreted to many different ideals within the Trovi.

>> ## <Badge type="warning" text="900EG" /> - BIRTH OF THE CENTER
>> #### Discovery, Scientific
>> Through constant research and pushing the boundaries of what the current science was capable of the Center was created. The Trovi who were relentless in the search of knowledge in all categories created an artificial intelligence where all data could be entered and stored ensuring that with each passing Trovi no knowledge would be lost ever again. The Center would use massive amounts of computing power to solve problems by running data set after data set, permutation after permutation, solving problems, helping cure disease, and a number of other things that were not possible by any individual Trovi. To date, it is the Trovi's crowning achievement.

>> ## <Badge type="warning" text="980EG" /> - BIRTH OF CADOR
>> #### Life, Birth
>> The birth of Cador, the one who would later discover the means to safely Bond with Boid enhancing the Nol to become even greater than they previously thought possible.

>> ## <Badge type="warning" text="1012EG" /> - DISCOVERY OF THE BOID PSYCHE
>> #### Discovery, Scientific
>> Through studying an advanced spore that had been Bonded to a creature for a prolonged time Cador discovers the Boid Psyche. Boid were not only simple intelligence but could think for themselves using bio chemical siagnals. Studying the advanced sample Cador discovers the missing piece to his puzzle. Boid can only forcibly bond with creatures with lesser intelligence. To bond a higher intelligence the bond has to be a mutual bond. This discovery shatters many of the theories that he and The Center had come up with to this point.

>> ## <Badge type="warning" text="1013EG" /> - THE DISCOVERY OF THE BRIDGE
>> #### Discovery, Scientific
>> Cador with the help of Natalen mand Kliastar discover what they call The Bridge. A brain-machine interface utilizing the Centers AI to help facilitate a safe and stable two-way connection with the Boid Psyche and the Nol mind.
