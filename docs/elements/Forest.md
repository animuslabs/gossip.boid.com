# The Boid Forest

The, forest, the Boid, to some they are completely different but to the keen eye they are one and the same.
hero
The Boid Forest covers the vast expanse outside of Nol society. The only place where the forest doesn't exist is within the Nol settlement itself. Until recent years it was left untouched. With the recent expansion of the Nol the Boid Forest is being cut down further with each year. The Boid forest represent equilibrium with nature. The Boid view the Boid forest as part of itself. Each tree in the forest has a special name and provides a sense of unity and moral boost for the Boid nearby.

Excerpt:

"The Forest, the trees, mean so much more than we ever thought." Cador said deep in thought. The newly awakened sense within him stirred jovially. The Boid inside him, his Boid, was beyond anything he had ever dreamed of. The Boid were so much more intelligent than they could have ever thought possible. The knowledge and the intelligence of the Nol was much like a focused point where the Boid were just as intelligent but scattered, not focused at all. Cador was the first successful Bonded after many, many failures. He had no more volunteers except himself. Every failure, every death was worth every moment of what he was feeling right now. His eyes were finally opened. He could sense the Boid spores outside the Nol settlement, he could feel the trees, their presence was almost calming. Calming in a way he couldn't describe. Each tree bouyed him. It was almost euphoric. "The Nol cannot be allowed to cut any more down. We need harmony, we need peace." The Bridge that facilitated his bond fit snugly within the membrane of his ear. Ten times smaller than the original prototype he barely even noticed it was there. The Boid within him hummed in agreement. Somehow he would teach his Boid to talk. He was sure it could understand. So much uncovered knowledge. He grabbed his notes and headed toward the Nolic Council to not only proclaim his discovery, but issue warning at further expansion. The Boid were angry and if the Nol thought the last war was devastating they had no idea what was coming for them next.

"To be one with nature is to be one with the Boid."

~Cador, The First of the Bonded.
