# The First Boidic War
As the Nol discovered the Boid colonies they probed their planet and found that the primitive intelligence covered their planet. After deliberation, the Nolic Council considered them a planetary nuisance and formed Extermination Squads to eliminate the Boid Colonies.
 
The Extermination Squads pushed outward from their Nol Settlement razing the ground and exterminating countless Boid in an expanding circle. The larger, more intelligent Boid Colonies pooled their resources and their Bonded creatures to protect their colonies. The wildlife fell in droves at the Nol advanced. Casualties on the Nolic side were few and far between but the slaughter that occurred to the Boid was immeasurable. The war came to an end as the last of the large Boid colonies fell. 
 
As the influence of the large colonies disappeared the Nol declared a victory and complete annihilation of the Boid. The small young Boid colonies went completely undiscovered by the Nol as they had been shadowed and protected by the larger more established colonies.
