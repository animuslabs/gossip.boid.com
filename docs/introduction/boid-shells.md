# Boid Shells

As Nol researchers advanced their understanding of the Boid lifecycle and opened up avenues of communication with hyphid colonies they realized they were dealing with a form of intelligence they had never encountered before. They taught the Boid how to live in balance with their environment instead of constantly spreading and overtaking all life on the planet. They considered the natural life-cycle of overtaking natural life to be unethical so they used their knowledge of Bioengineering to construct Shells, custom biomechanical host bodies with blank minds for the Boid to inhabit. While the shell host bodies proved to be popular with the Boid they reduce the experiences the hyphid colony can absorb and limited colony growth.
