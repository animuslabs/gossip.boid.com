# The First Bonded

While the Trovi was founded in 615 EG the first Trovi to discover the ability to bond Boid successfully was named Cador. Cador thirsts for knowledge. Exploring the intimate depths of the Boid relationship against the wishes of the council he pioneered what is now known as the Bridge. His thirst for knowledge also led to the birth of The Medent. The Discovery of the Bridge and the unwitting birth of the Medent represented a fork in Nolic history. The Bridge would lead the Nol and Boid to great heights while the Medent would plague the land for centuries to come. 

 Excerpt: 

Cador Searched and searched for the answer. "Where is it?" Netelen wasn't the first nor would she be the last. His failures were stacking up. He knew what he searched for was hidden within them all he had to do was keep searching, keep searching and he would find what he needed. The Bridge is almost stable, almost stable. The Trovi volunteer stepped forward. Cador attached the latest Bridge that he had put together. Slight modifications in the Bridging technology and extensive improvements to the training regiment let him to this point. He would see this through. Taking one last look at his notes he activated the now familiar process once more.  



 "The way of the True Seekers is to grasp out of the dark knowing that with each grasp of light they are illuminating the path for those that come after."
