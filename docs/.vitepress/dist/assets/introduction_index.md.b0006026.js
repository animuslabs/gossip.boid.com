The largest difference in this universe is that life evolved very quickly after the \u201Cbig bang\u201D and the expansion of space is very slow. This means that in the Boid universe it\u2019s actually possible to traverse all of space, which is curved like a planet into an extra dimension. FTL travel isn\u2019t necessary due to the size of space and safe/stable wormholes that connect various parts of space together.
