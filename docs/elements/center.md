# The Center
The Center is artificial intelligence where all data could be entered and stored ensuring that with each passing generation the wealth of information that the Trovi collected would be forgotten. The Center uses massive amounts of computing power to solve algorithmic problems by running data set after data set, permutation after permutation, solving problems, helping cure disease, and a number of other things that were not possible by any individual Trovi. As days pass the Center grows and evolves with each passing generation and becomes more integral to Nolic society.
## Purpose / Function
The Center's purpose is to collect and assist the Trovi in their research in every way possible. Through the collective minds of the Trovi and the Centers artificial intelligence, The Bridge is created. The miniaturized technology allows the Trovi to interface with the Boid and becomes Bonded. Every Bridge is considered a branch of the Center and contains a portion of it and constantly interfaces with the main hub and facilitates the link between the Trovi and the Bonded.
## Architecture
The Center is constructed purely of a metallic crystal known as the Boid Crystal. The rare crystal allows the transmittal and storage of data while providing integral structural strength matched by no other material. The Boid Crystal is considered the holy grail of materials. In every application, the Boid Crystal almost feels alive as it adapts to the task at hand. The Center is a set of circular domes of Boid Crystal intermixed with lush greenery in an open and inviting manner. The interior is lined with staircases supported by the great trees that the Center was built around, automatic rope lifts, and a wealth of advanced computing equipment that makes up the Center itself.
## Defenses
The Center is the pinnacle of Trovi achievement of blending science and nature. To that extent there are no direct defenses surrounding The Center.
