The Trovi also developed the physical and psychological conditioning processes that were needed prior to implantation in order to ensure a successful link. The process was highly experimental but the Trovi were not afraid of the challenges. Many Trovi died during early experiments and some were able to cultivate the Boid mind but unable to control it or stuck in inner turmoil that drove the Nol mind insane. Once the Trovi had developed a process that was repeatable they started to share their findings with other Nol groups who refined the bridge process.",-1),d=e("hr",null,null,-1),l=e("p",null,[e("strong",null,'by "John H."')],-1),h=[i,s,d,l];function c(p,u,v,m,_,f){return a(),o("div",null,h)}const g=t(r,[["render",c]]);export{b as __pageData,g as default};
