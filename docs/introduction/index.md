# Universe
Boid society exists in a universe not much different from our own, with space, planets, stars and gravity. The largest difference in this universe is that life evolved very quickly after the “big bang” and the expansion of space is very slow. This means that in the Boid universe it’s actually possible to traverse all of space, which is curved like a planet into an extra dimension. FTL travel isn’t necessary due to the size of space and safe/stable wormholes that connect various parts of space together. Space is divided into interconnected hexagonal cells (hexasphere) with a solar system in each cell. Nearly every planet contains varieties of simple forms of life and it’s not uncommon for life to easily spread from planet to planet within a solar system.
