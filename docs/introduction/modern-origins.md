# Modern Origins

The first alien race to domesticate Hyphid is called the Nol. The Nol are a peaceful and highly-intelligent and evolved race of humanoids. Their bird-like features and lightweight frame makes them fragile in physical confrontations so they have developed ways to solve problems using their intellect and technology. Nol scientists discovered a young Hyphid colony and after studying the way the Hyphid augments host bodies, wanted to develop a system that would enable the Nol to take advantage of those capabilities. The breakthrough came in the form of a superconductor based brain-machine interface utilizing AI to facilitate safe and stable two-way communication with the Boid Psyche and the Nol mind. Even with this new bridge of communication the Nol found that extensive training was required for potential hosts to obtain the ability to maintain a healthy Boid inside their mind. If the hyphid is able to establish the Boid consciousness the Boid co-exists in the conscious mind of the host similar to a second personality. Developing a symbiotic relationship with a Boid consciousness grants many advantages to hosts who have trained to cultivate such a relationship.
