# The Boid Wars
While the Nol are physically weak they have very advanced technology and strategic insight with little oversight. Meanwhile the Boid mostly rely on great numbers instead of expert strategy. To level the field the Boid colonies developed some battle shells. Eventually after a long drawn out cold war with occasional physical battles, both sides settled on an uneasy truce. The Boid colonies realized they would never truly be free if they continued to share the planet with the Nol so they began construction of ships that would carry them to another planet where they hoped they could live in peace.
