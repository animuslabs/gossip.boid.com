# Bonded
The process of a Boid Spore linking with a host organism. Bonding can occur with lesser organisms. As the Boid colony grows its intelligence grows and it can learn to affect greater intelligence.
 
Due to the experimentation of the Trovi they have managed to reach a form of equilibrium bond with Boid spores taking hold of the positive benefits of the Boid bond without the Boid overrunning the host. They reach equilibrium with each other and learn to grow and communicate with one another. Some Boid and Nol Bonded have become friends.
## Transmission & Vectors
An established Boid colony produces fruiting bodies that produce spores. Spores can attach to lesser species in the following known ways:
 
- Through Inhalation
- Through prolonged contact with skin(Long enough for the the Boid to begin establishing its roots. Known as the Transition.)
- Through open wounds.
- Through contact with another Bonded carrying spores.
- Larger more established Boid colonies are rumored to be able to attach in other ways.

## Causes
A Boid colony that has reached an established level will start sending out spores to grow and protect the Boid colony. Every colony can send out thousands of spores each day through its fruiting bodies. The spores themselves are very durable and can handle extreme environments. However if a Boid spore doesn't attach itself within a certain time period the Boid spore will die.
 
Time of a Boid spore:
 
- Variable:
1. Depends on environmental conditions and how much of their energy is spent. i.e. A Boid spores lifespan will see a drastic reduction in lifespan in extreme heat or cold.
2. Altitude plays a part but the exact ramifications is unknown.
3. Level of established Boid colony. A larger colonies spores will have a much greater energy density and therefore a much longer lifespan.

## Symptoms
The symptoms of a lesser species being infected will manifest over the course of the week as the Boid spore begins a complete takeover of the host creature.
 
During the first week it has been observed that creatures undergo the following:
 
- Temporary paralysis
- Limb spasms
- The short-term loss of various motor functions such as chew, walk, blink, climb, fly, etc.
- Death( Not all subjects prove to be a viable host for the Boid spore. However the Boid spore will infect the corpse and can travel to a new host via ingestion.)

Other symptoms seem to be present. Further observation is required.

## Treatment
At the current time, there is no foreseeable action that can be taken to safely remove the Boid spore once it has bonded with a creature. Based on current data it is believed that the host creature is killed off as the transition finalizes. 
 
Further analysis is required.

## Prognosis
Condition for the Host is fatal. As the Bond becomes stronger less and less of the original species remains. Observation dictates that the condition is fatal for the host.
 
further observation and research required.

## Hosts & Carriers
Only fauna can be affected by the Boid spores. As a colony grows the vegetation around it swells but not due to any Bond that is seen. We are unsure of the cause at this point.
 
More research is required.
